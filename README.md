🧠 Visualizing Wellness: Mental Health Awareness Dashboard – India 2025
Mental health matters — and data can make a difference.
 I'm excited to share my latest Power BI project: a Mental Health Awareness Dashboard focused on visualizing trends, stress sources, and therapy access across India in 2025.
💡 What this dashboard includes:
 📍 State-wise awareness 
 📊 Anxiety, depression, and burnout indicators by age, gender & profession
 💬 Campaign impact visualized through stress reduction trends
 📈 Therapy access gaps & awareness analysis
Tools used:
 ✔️ Power BI (Map visuals, DAX, KPIs, Donut )
 ✔️ Custom CSV datasets with 200+ entries
Why this project?
 Because raising awareness isn’t just a social cause — it’s a data-driven opportunity to understand and improve lives.
